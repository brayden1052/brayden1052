### 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Brayden Newsom**, a recent graduate with a **B.S. in Computer Science** from the University of Utah 🎓.

- 💼 I recently completed a Software Engineer Internship at **ThriftBooks**, where I built a Flask-based web application with Azure APIs and Elasticsearch.
- 🌍 I build full-stack apps that solve real-world problems — from classroom management systems to smart parking platforms.
- ⚙️ I enjoy working with modern tools and frameworks like **Vue.js, C#, PostgreSQL, Supabase, and AWS**.
